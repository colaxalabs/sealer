# sealer: attest property ownership

Land property owners can attest to title deed ownership by uploading their rights to the blockchain. Owners can prove ownership by submitting their cryptographic signature to a smart contract to attest ownership to a property. Tenants can submit bids off-chain to rent a partial or a whole property and both the tenant and the owner can sign the bid off-chain and seal the bid on-chain. Tenant can prove usage rights to a property by submitting their cryptographic signature to a smart contract.

This repository contains all the smart contract that implement property attestation protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.
